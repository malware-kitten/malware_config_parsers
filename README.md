malware_config_parsers
======================

A collection of public malware config parsers. Each script is it's own self contained script.  At some point they might tie together into a bigger framework, but at the moment this will be a collection of one-off's.

Ruby is used for a majority of these decoders.  

The following libraries are used.
* capstone engine  (https://github.com/aquynh/capstone)
* crabstone        (https://github.com/bnagy/crabstone)
* pedump           (https://github.com/zed-0xff/pedump)
